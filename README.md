# InstaPic
An open-source script written in Ruby to access the profile picture of an Instagram user.

# How it works?
+ Execute: `ruby InstaPic.rb`
+ Enter an Instagram username :)
If you have Firefox, it will show you the picture automatically. Otherwise, comment the 39th line, and it will generate the link for you.
+ 39th Line : `system("firefox #{encurl}")`
+ After commenting it: #system("firefox #{encurl}")
